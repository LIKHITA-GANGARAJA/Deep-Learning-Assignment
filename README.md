Deep Learning Assignment – CNN & RNN

This repository contains two deep learning implementations developed for my course assignment.
The CNN model performs image classification using the Animals-10 dataset, and the RNN model uses an LSTM-based architecture for sentiment analysis on the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset. Both projects include data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and the required Google Colab notebooks with PDF exports.
