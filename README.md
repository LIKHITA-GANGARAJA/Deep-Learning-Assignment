# Deep-Learning-Assignment
This repository contains my Deep Learning assignment featuring two models: a CNN for image classification using the Animals-10 dataset and an LSTM-based RNN for sentiment analysis using the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset. Both implementations include data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
